Are you someone who frequently reads or writes research papers. Do you get exhausted while searching for the citations? Moving back and forth between the pages and the citation section, and then searching for those papers with the DOI. Too much of work right?

Ahh! So cliche.

If Yes, then this tool is going to make your life simple!

Double clicking any text will give you a bubble popup displaying the top 5 citations, youtube links, google scholar links, and github links. You can highlight any term, and this tool will provide you its meaning from wikipedia and also provides udemy and coursera links. You get everything in the bubble popup.
