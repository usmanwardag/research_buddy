|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing	
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.	
|Use of version control tools	
|Use of style checkers	config files                                                                            |in GH showing your config

|test cases are routinely executed	                                                                            |e.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something
|the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up	
|issues are discussed before they are closed	|even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here
|Chat channel: exists	
|test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.	|if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it
|evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files	
|evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)	
|evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)	
|evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base	
|short release cycles	|(hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work
